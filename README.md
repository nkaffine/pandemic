## Setup
There are three things necesarry to set this project up (hopefully)
1. Install postgresql on your computer. This is the database that we will be using for the app. (On linux you should be able to juts copy and paste `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib`
2. Install your favorite web development IDE. I am a fan of Jetbrains product so I recommend WebStorm with a student license.
3. Run setup.sh (hopefully this just works, I haven't really tested it, it just runs a bunch of install commands)
